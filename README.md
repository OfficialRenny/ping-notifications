# ping-notifications
Tool that allows you to ping multiple IPv4 addresses at an interval, can run in the background and gives you a notification when a server isn't responding.

has been known to work, made in a couple hours and most of the code is from stack overflow

reason for making: wanted to see if and when servers go down and be notified of it (primarily for [90dns](https://gbatemp.net/threads/90dns-dns-server-for-blocking-all-nintendo-servers.516234/) which i've expanded upon)
